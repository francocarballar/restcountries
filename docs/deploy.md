This API is designed to be deployed to Cloudflare Workers using the Wrangler CLI.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm/yarn/bun installed.
- A Cloudflare account.
- Wrangler CLI installed globally or as a dev dependency (`npm install -g wrangler` or `bun add -d wrangler`).

## Configuration

1.  **Login to Cloudflare:**

    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

    Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Cloudflare account.

2.  **Review `wrangler.jsonc` (or `wrangler.toml`):**
    - Ensure the `name` property reflects the desired name for your Worker service.
    - Verify the `main` property points to the correct entry file (likely related to `src/app/index.ts` after build). _(Exact path depends on build output)_
    - Check `compatibility_date` and update if necessary.
    - Confirm the `account_id` is present or configured via environment variables/secrets if needed.
    - _(Add any specific details found in wrangler.jsonc, like KV namespaces, routes, etc. if they were present)_

## Build

Before deploying, you need to build the TypeScript code into JavaScript suitable for Cloudflare Workers.

```bash
# Check package.json for the exact build script
bun run build
# Or: npm run build / yarn build
```

This command typically uses `tsc` or another bundler (like esbuild via Hono's build tools) to compile the code, often outputting to a `dist` directory.

## Deploy

Once built, deploy the worker using Wrangler:

```bash
# Check package.json for the exact deploy script
bun run deploy
# Or directly using wrangler:
# wrangler deploy
```

Wrangler will upload the built code and configure the Worker according to `wrangler.jsonc`. After deployment, it will usually output the URL where the Worker is accessible.

## CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)

_(No specific CI/CD configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) was detected in the repository structure provided.)_

To set up CI/CD:

1.  Create workflow files (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
2.  Configure steps to:
    - Checkout the code.
    - Set up Node.js/Bun.
    - Install dependencies (`bun install`).
    - Build the project (`bun run build`).
    - Deploy using Wrangler (`wrangler deploy`).
3.  Store Cloudflare API tokens (`CF_API_TOKEN`) and `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` securely as secrets in your CI/CD environment. The Wrangler deploy command can use these environment variables for authentication.
